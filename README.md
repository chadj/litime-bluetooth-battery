# Li Time Bluetooth Battery Data Read
Web application to monitor the Li Time 100Ah Group 24 LiFePO4 Battery over bluetooth (w/ Web Bluetooth API).  No server needed.  All client side javascript.  This is a simple app to demonstrate the code and protocol needed to read battery states such as temperature, volts and current.  Feel free reuse and adapt this code for your own project.

This code has only been tested with the Li Time 100Ah Group 24 LiFePO4 Battery w/ Bluetooth.  That's the only one I own.  I developed this code to learn how to read the temperature off of the battery.
